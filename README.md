# Fire Presence

A sample app for demonstrating how to update user presence on [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore). There is no direct method present to do that, but it can be easily achieved using some other Firebase services, like [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database) and [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).
